# Data, Me, and Everything

## About Me
Welcome! This is where I turn messy data into stories, patterns, and useful answers. From digging through numbers to building models, these projects show how I make sense of the noise - and have a little fun along the way.

## Projects

### Project 1
- A comprehensive data integration and analysis project combining web-scraped data, SQL databases, and API calls to study global amusement park attendance and roller coaster characteristics. The project merges information from Wikipedia, Queue Times API, and the Roller Coaster Database, resolving inconsistencies across datasets to build a unified theme park dataset.
