# Data, Me, and Everything

## About Me
Welcome! I am a young data scientist ready to turn messy data into stories, patterns, and useful answers. From digging through numbers to building models, these projects show how I make sense of the noise - and have a little fun along the way.

## Work/Projects

### Project 1: To Be Announced

### [Project 2: Beyond the Hype: Predicting Film Success from Historical Data](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/film-financial-indicator)
- This project uses regression and classification build a predictive model that predetermines a film’s success from factors known before green-lighting production, so studios and stars can make better choices about where and how to invest their resources. It reveals that while historical star power correlates with future success, budget is ultimately the most important indicator of whether a film is a financial success or failure.

### [Project 3: Does Tanking Pay? The Hidden Costs of Losing in the NBA](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/basketball-tanking-costs)
- This project investigates whether NBA teams suffer hidden financial and fan engagement costs when deliberately losing (tanking) to secure better draft picks. Using regression analysis on decades of data, it reveals that while attendance often holds steady due to loyal fans, tanking risks revenue stagnation and brand damage—especially for small-market teams.

### [Project 4: Forecasting TV Series Success with Machine Learning](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/imdb-project)
- This project builds predictive models to forecast television series success using Nielsen ratings, IMDb data, social media sentiment, and streaming statistics. Combining web scraping, API data, and machine learning (Random Forests, Extra Trees, Mixed Linear Models), it predicts ratings, audience size, and cancellation risk with high accuracy.

### [Project 5: Money, Votes, and Influence: Predicting Congressional Voting Patterns](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/politician-voting-prediction)
- This project uses machine learning to predict U.S. congressional votes and measure how financial contributions shape legislative decisions. Using VoteView, OpenSecrets, and lobbying data, I built a classifier that reveals how money influences bill outcomes and voting behavior.

### [Project 6: Global Theme Park Attendance & Ride Analysis](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/theme-park-popularity)
- A comprehensive data integration and analysis project combining web-scraped data, SQL databases, and API calls to study global amusement park attendance and roller coaster characteristics. The project merges information from Wikipedia, Queue Times API, and the Roller Coaster Database, resolving inconsistencies across datasets to build a unified theme park dataset.

### [Project 7: The Statistical Reality of the NBA Draft](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/basketball-win-shares)
- An in-depth analysis of NBA draft efficiency and team performance from 1981 to 2023. Using Python, SQLite, and custom metrics, this project examines player impact, draft value, franchise spending, and postseason success, revealing the hidden patterns behind successful (and costly) teams.

### [Project 8: Political Migration and Its Electoral Impact: A Data-Driven Study](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/political-migration-project)
- This project analyzes how internal U.S. migration affects political outcomes in battleground states. Using IRS migration data and election results, I built an R-based model to estimate partisan shifts from 2011 to 2020, highlighting how relocation patterns shape elections.

### [Project 9: Weather App: Python + OpenWeatherMap](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/weather)
- A lightweight weather app built in Python. Fast, clean, and reliable, it fetches real-time forecasts using OpenWeatherMap and handles even the messiest user input gracefully.

### [Project 10: Thrill Rides vs. Themed Lands: A Trend Analysis](https://github.com/kvsgouker/final-project-portfolio/tree/main/theme-parks-vs-amusement-parks)
- An exploratory PowerPoint project analyzing theme park trends using Google Trends data. This project compares the popularity of thrill coasters versus themed lands, highlighting early skills in data visualization, trend mapping, and interpreting regional interest patterns.
